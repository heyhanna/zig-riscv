# Basic RISC-V Kernel in Zig

This repository contains very basic initialization code to start writing a
RISC-V kernel in the [Zig](https://ziglang.org) programming language. Compiling
and running the kernel should provide a basic kernel that halts on start.

## Directory Structure

```txt
src - base zig code for the kernel
src/asm - assembly files for booting and similar
src/kernel.lds - linker script to link the kernel
build.zig - the build script to compile the kernel
```
